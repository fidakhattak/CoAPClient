Californium (Cf) CoAP framework in Java
=======================================

Californium is a Java CoAP implementation targeting back-end services. Thus, the
focus is on usability and features, not on resource-efficiency like for embedded
devices. The Java implementation fosters quick server and client development.

Cf is now a MAVEN PROJECT!

Use "mvn clean install" in the Cf root directory to build everything.
Standalone JARs of the examples will be copied to ./run/.
(For convenience they are directly included in the Git repository.)

The Maven repositories are:
http://maven.thingml.org/archiva/repository/thingml-release
http://maven.thingml.org/archiva/repository/thingml-snapshot

The build status can be followed on:
